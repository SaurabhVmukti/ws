# Project Setup

This repository contains two folders: `frontend` and `backend`. These folders contain the code for the frontend and backend of the project, respectively. To get started, you will need to download and set up each folder separately.

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the `frontend` folder**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Backend

1. **Navigate to the `backend` folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npx nodemon ./serverwebsocket.js
   ```

## Running the Project

After setting up and starting both the frontend and backend servers, you will be able to see the alert box in your browser. The frontend will be served on the default port (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## Notes

- Ensure that both the frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously for the project to work correctly.
- If you encounter any issues, make sure you have the latest versions of Node.js and npm installed.

Happy coding!
